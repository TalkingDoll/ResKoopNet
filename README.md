# NN-ResDMD



---

## Instructions

### pendulum.m

The `pendulum.m` file is used to generate pendulum data.

### Experiments

I have provided two versions of experiments:

1. **TensorFlow Version**: `pendulum_nnresdmd_tf`
2. **PyTorch Version**: `pendulum_nnresdmd_torch`

### Solvers

The TensorFlow version of the solver is based on a modified version of the EDMD-DL solver. You can find more details [here](https://github.com/MLDS-NUS/KoopmanDL?tab=readme-ov-file).

### Plotting Tools

1. `koopman_pseudospec_qr` - A plotting tool to visualize the results. This is based on a reference implementation, which can be found [here](https://github.com/MColbrook/Residual-Dynamic-Mode-Decomposition/blob/main/main_routines/KoopPseudoSpecQR.m).

Feel free to explore these files and use them as needed for your experiments and analysis.
