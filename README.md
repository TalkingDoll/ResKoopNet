# NN-ResDMD



---

## Instructions

### pendulum.m

The `pendulum.m` file is used to generate pendulum data.

### Experiments

I have provided two versions of experiments:

1. `TensorFlow Version`: `pendulum_nnresdmd_tf.ipynb`
2. `PyTorch Version`: `pendulum_nnresdmd_torch.ipynb`

### Solvers

1. The `solver_edmd_tf.py` is based on a modified version of the EDMD-DL solver. You can find more details [here](https://github.com/MLDS-NUS/KoopmanDL?tab=readme-ov-file).
2. `solver_resdmd_tf.py` and `solver_resdmd_torch.py` are also modified based on the EDMD-DL solver.

### Plotting Tools

1. `koopman_pseudospec_qr` - A plotting tool to visualize the results. This Python file is translated from [here](https://github.com/MColbrook/Residual-Dynamic-Mode-Decomposition/blob/main/main_routines/KoopPseudoSpecQR.m).

Feel free to explore these files and use them as needed for your experiments and analysis.
